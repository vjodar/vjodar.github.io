The absentee ballot was an ongoing project during one of my ICS scripting classes during my time at Leeward Community College. It was a "Sticky Form" that used HTML for the markup, Javascript to handle the functions, and PHP for server side computations. I was able to recreate the Fall 2017 absentee ballot, in all its functionality and appearance. Some highlights of the ballot include input handling, where the form would be able to use regular expressions in order to determine if the user has entered valid input (such as phone numbers following a standard phone number format with parentheses, dashes, or just a 10 digit number), alerts warning a user via browser that they must check the associated checkbox affirming they provided correct personal information, buttons that causes the form to copy over address information in case the user would like to us their residence address for mailing purposes, and the form being able to retain all information in case the user submits the form without finishing. This functionality grants the user a smooth and helpful experience when filling out their absentee ballot.
